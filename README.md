# Reaver
RPG game using JavaScript with HTML5 canvas

<b>Description:</b> Project that I decided to continue to work on. I intend to create this game without using any major frameworks.
Currently I am in the process of adding object orientated structures to my JavaScript to clean up my code. As I begin to learn more about other languages, I start to come back to these projects and recreate them.
